  })); 
  /* 
  we will see three, two, one all recorded when we click on the div.three
  this is because of bubbling 

  what is bubbling?  
  It happens when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) 
  to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element
  
  In fact, even body is considered clicked on but it is not registered because we didn't add an event listener to it 
  */

  /* When a click happens, browser will "capture" events that happened in a top down manner from the root, before bubbling up and calling the 
  action handler for every click captured.

  addEventListener has a capture parameter, which defines how the order of how the action handler is called.
  When it is true, it will call the handler in the order it captures the events instead. 
  
  TLDR; capture property controls order of bubbling*/
